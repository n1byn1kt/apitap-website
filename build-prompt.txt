Build the apitap.io landing page as a single self-contained index.html file (no build tools, no framework — just HTML/CSS/JS that opens directly in a browser).

## Context
Read this brainstorm doc first: ~/clawd/projects/apitap/docs/website-brainstorm.md

## What ApiTap is
An MCP server that turns any website into an API — no docs, no SDK, no browser.
- Captures a site's internal API endpoints via Playwright network interception
- Generates portable "skill files" (JSON maps of endpoints)  
- Replays them with fetch() — no browser, 100x fewer tokens
- 789 tests, v1.0.6, BSL-1.1 (free for non-commercial)
- Install: npm install -g @apitap/core

## Token numbers (use these exactly)
- YouTube video: 36 tokens (vs ~4,200 browser)
- Reddit thread: 627 tokens (vs ~8,900 browser)
- Wikipedia article: 127 tokens (vs ~4,900 browser)
- HN thread: ~200 tokens (vs ~2,000 browser)

## Design direction
- Dark developer aesthetic — color palette: #0a0a0f bg, #141420 surface, #00e5c0 teal accent, #ff4d4d red, #ffb84d amber, #e8e8f0 text
- Fonts from Google Fonts: JetBrains Mono (headings, code), Inter (body)
- Make the TOKEN NUMBERS visceral — 36 vs 4,900 is the centerpiece
- No stock illustrations, no blob SVGs, no purple gradients
- Dense, not spacious — developers don't want whitespace cathedrals
- Terminal-look code blocks with syntax highlighting

## Required sections (single scroll page)
1. Sticky nav: "ApiTap" logo + anchor links + GitHub star button
2. Hero: H1 "Skip the browser. Call the API." (typewriter stagger) + interactive token widget right column
3. Problem: Two-column cards "The Browser Way" (red) vs "The ApiTap Way" (green) with real numbers
4. How It Works: 3-step pipeline: Capture → Skill File → Replay
5. Live Demos: Tabbed interface — YouTube (36t), Reddit (627t), Wikipedia (127t), Any Site
6. Security: 2x3 grid of 6 cards (SSRF protection, skill signing, encrypted auth, PII scrubbing, read-only capture, header injection protection)
7. Get Started: Terminal with install commands + MCP client logos row
8. Footer: minimal

## Interactive token widget (hero right column)
- Terminal-style dark box
- Three preset buttons: [YouTube] [Reddit] [Wikipedia]
- On click: show animation sequence with terminal output
- Big red bar = browser tokens, tiny teal bar = ApiTap tokens
- Numbers count up to final values
- Pure vanilla JS only

## Animations
- Hero headline: CSS stagger animation (each word/line staggers in, 150ms delay between)
- Token count-up: JS counter animation
- Sections: fade-in on scroll via IntersectionObserver
- Tab switch: smooth crossfade
- No animation on code blocks (devs want to read them)

## Copy to use
Headline: "Skip the browser. Call the API."
Subhead: "Every website has an API powering it. ApiTap finds it, captures it, and lets your AI agent call it directly — no browser, no scraping, no DOM. Just structured JSON at 1/100th the token cost."
Problem section: "Browser automation was built for humans. Your AI agent isn't one."
How It Works: "Three steps. No browser after step one."
Security: "Hardened for production."
Get Started: "Two commands. Then ask your agent to browse."
Tagline: "The web was built for human eyes; ApiTap makes it native to machines."

## Install commands
